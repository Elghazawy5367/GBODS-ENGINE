# GBODS Methodology — The 8-Stage Framework

## Core Principle

> Pain that exists at the **intersection** of two or more niches is invisible to
> any expert working inside a single domain. This is where blue oceans form.

## Stage Breakdown

### Stage 1: LOCATE — Named Intersection Pain
Coin a precise 2-4 word label for pain that only exists at V1 × V2.
**Example:** "Fee-Trauma Paralysis" (ADHD × Etsy sellers)

### Stage 2: DIAGNOSE — TRIZ Contradiction
Identify the structural contradiction: improving X necessarily worsens Y.
Apply one of TRIZ's 40 inventive principles to resolve it.

### Stage 3: SPECIFY — Jobs-to-be-Done
Map the real job: "When I [situation], help me [motivation] so I can [outcome]"
Identify why all current solutions score minimum satisfaction.

### Stage 4: EXPAND — Six Paths Borrow
Find an adjacent industry that partially solves this problem.
Import a specific mechanic from that industry.

### Stage 5: EXCAVATE — Blocking Assumption
Identify the single false belief preventing solutions from existing.
Describe what becomes possible when you assume the opposite.

### Stage 6: ARCHITECT — Value Flow Reroute
Map the current broken value flow in one sentence.
Design the fixed flow with the proposed product.

### Stage 7: TIME — Window Urgency
Surface 3 converging signals creating urgency RIGHT NOW.
Rate window 1-10 with specific justification.

### Stage 8: LEVERAGE — Paradigm Shift
Craft a frame-shifting statement that makes competition irrelevant.
This is the "aha" that redefines the category.

## Scoring Formula

```
GBODS Score = (Solo Viability × 0.40)
            + (Effort/Income Ratio × 0.30)
            + (Window Urgency × 10 × 0.30)

Solo Viability: 0-100 — Can one person execute this?
Effort/Income:  0-100 — Revenue per hour of effort
Window Urgency: 1-10  — How time-sensitive is this opportunity?
```

## Constraint Profile

Every opportunity must pass the user's hard constraints:
- Role limitations (non-technical, solo, etc.)
- Budget ceiling
- Time-to-revenue requirement
- Skill restrictions
- Format restrictions (no SaaS, no services, etc.)

Opportunities violating ANY constraint are rejected.
